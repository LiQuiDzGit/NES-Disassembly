# NES Disassembly for Mesen NEA Audio
Source code for Mesen HD Audio (NEA)

This repository contains NES ROM disassembly files prepared and annotated for use with Mesen’s NEA Audio system. 

NEA (Nintendo Enhanced Audio) works similarly to the MSU-1 audio enhancement on the SNES, allowing the emulator to play high-quality external audio (OGG/WAV) in place of or alongside the original NES music and sound effects.

These disassemblies help identify sound engine routines, BGM/SFX pointers, and patchable hooks needed to integrate custom audio tracks.
